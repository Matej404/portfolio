                            Learning to code been difficult and arduous journey,
                            however, I have never done something so rewarding. Now, I feel at
                            a point where I can build multipage websites with my HTML and CSS 
                            skills. I have also spent time learning and practicing  JavaScript
                            (including working with API's), functional programming and object
                            oriented programming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am aware this is a fast growing modern industry. Therefore, I 
                            made sure to learn and use frameworks and tools such a React,
                            SASS and most recently, styled components in order to
                            efficiently build websites using the last tools.

                            I am a developer because I'm inspired to be a better me today then 
                            I was yesterday. Put simply, I love to learn and coding
                            is great example of that.
